OpenThrust
========

OpenThrust is a software created by members of the Waterloo Rocketry design team at the University of Waterloo. The aim of the project is to provide an accurate thrust curve and apogee prediction for hybrid engine rockets that use NOS as their oxidizer.

Using the Program
-----------------

Right now to use the program, you should first generate an RPA table using RPA software found here: http://www.propulsion-analysis.com/index.htm. For our purposes, the free version worked fine.
The table should have increments of 10 Psi for the pressure and 0.1 for the OF ratio.
Then you should create a settings file as outlined in the wiki.
After that build and run the program.
